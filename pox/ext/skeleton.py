A skeleton POX component

You can customize this to do whatever you like.  Don't forget to
adjust the Copyright above, and to delete the Apache license if you
don't want to release under Apache (but consider doing so!).

Rename this file to whatever you like, .e.g., mycomponent.py.  You can
then invoke it with "./pox.py mycomponent" if you leave it in the
ext/ directory.

Implement a launch() function (as shown below) which accepts commandline
arguments and starts off your component (e.g., by listening to events).

Edit this docstring and your launch function's docstring.  These will
show up when used with the help component ("./pox.py help --mycomponent").

  # When your component is specified on the commandline, POX automatically
  # calls this function.

  # Add whatever parameters you want to this.  They will become
  # commandline arguments.  You can specify default values or not.
  # In this example, foo is required and bar is not.  You may also
  # specify a keyword arguments catch-all (e.g., **kwargs).

  # For example, you can execute this component as:
  # ./pox.py skeleton --foo=3 --bar=4

  # Note that arguments passed from the commandline are ordinarily
  # always strings, and it's up to you to validate and convert them.
  # The one exception is if a user specifies the parameter name but no
  # value (e.g., just "--foo").  In this case, it receives the actual
  # Python value True.
  # The @pox.util.eval_args decorator interprets them as if they are
  # Python literals.  Even things like --foo=[1,2,3] behave as expected.
  # Things that don't appear to be Python literals are left as strings.

  # If you want to be able to invoke the component multiple times, add
  # __INSTANCE__=None as the last parameter.  When multiply-invoked, it
  # will be passed a tuple with the following:
  # 1. The number of this instance (0...n-1)
  # 2. The total number of instances for this module
  # 3. True if this is the last instance, False otherwise
  # The last is just a comparison between #1 and #2, but is convenient.
