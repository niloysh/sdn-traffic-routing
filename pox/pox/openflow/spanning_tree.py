Creates a spanning tree.

This component uses the discovery component to build a view of the network
topology, constructs a spanning tree, and then disables flooding on switch
ports that aren't on the tree by setting their NO_FLOOD bit.  The result
is that topologies with loops no longer turn your network into useless
hot packet soup.

This component is inspired by and roughly based on the description of
Glenn Gibb's spanning tree module for NOX:
  http://www.openflow.org/wk/index.php/Basic_Spanning_Tree

Note that this does not have much of a relationship to Spanning Tree
Protocol.  They have similar purposes, but this is a rather different way
of going about it.
