Components and lib for working with various protocols.

This package contains stuff for working with protocols.  In general, this
does not include stuff for actually working with the wire formats of protocols
(this is handled by pox.lib.packet).  However, there are helpers for working
with protocols here, as well as POX implementations of some protocols (e.g.,
DHCP).
